## Verse 1

We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I (do I). A full commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand

## Chorus

Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
